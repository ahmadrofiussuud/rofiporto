This was the semester of "Yes." Yes to the hackathon that cost me a weekend of sleep. Yes to leading the technical team for a student organization. I realized that technology is a multiplier for community impact.

**Key Lessons:**
*   **Speed vs. Quality:** Hackathons taught me to ship fast; class projects taught me to architect well. Balancing both is the art.
*   **User-Centricity:** Building `Campus Connect` showed me that the best code is useless if it doesn't solve a user's pain point.
*   **Network matters:** The friends I made in the computer lab are now my co-founders and collaborators.
