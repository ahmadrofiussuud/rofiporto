I thought I knew how to code, but university taught me how to *engineer*. I struggled initially with C++ pointers and the abstract nature of Data Structures. However, I found my footing by applying these concepts to real problems on campus.

**Key Lessons:**
*   **Theory needs practice:** Algorithms only made sense when I tried to visualize them or use them in a project.
*   **Teamwork is a skill:** Building `Smart Canteen` with 3 others taught me that git conflicts are harder than coding bugs.
*   **Resilience:** Failing my first few assignments didn't stop me; it forced me to improve my study habits.
