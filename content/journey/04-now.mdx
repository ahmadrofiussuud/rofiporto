Today, I see myself not just as a student, but as a junior engineer ready for the industry. I spend my days refactoring old codebases, learning about cloud infrastructure, and mentoring younger students. My journey is just beginning.

**Key Lessons:**
*   **Clean Code:** I now write code for the "future me" (or the next developer) to read, not just for the compiler.
*   **Continuous Learning:** The tech stack changes every 6 months; the ability to learn is the only constant skill.
*   **Impact:** I want my work to touch lives, whether it's simplifying a canteen queue or connecting a campus.
